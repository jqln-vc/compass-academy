## INTRODUÇÃO AO AWS S3: SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE

### PREFIXOS

You can use prefixes to organize the data that you store in Amazon S3 buckets. A prefix is a string
of characters at the beginning of the object key name. A prefix can be any length, subject to
the maximum length of the object key name (1,024 bytes). You can think of prefixes as a way to
organize your data in a similar way to directories. However, prefixes are not directories (AWS, p. 358)
