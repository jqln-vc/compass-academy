Bhotbhoti's belief was further strenthened when he found out, not in the distant past, a story (movie) on mermaids that floats on the televison screen, called The Mermaid Princess. His most prized possession, the dvd of the film stays in his little trunk under his chowki (bed) until he takes it out every night and puts it into his battered but not run-down collected and repaired dvd player which brings to him his Ariel (the name of the mermaid in the film). The Ganges calls out to him and while his friends (group members) are sloshed, he dives into the waters to look for his mermaid queen, but she is ever-elusive."

And the role of sister represents the public who feel that this relationship is \"wrong\" according to social ethics and moral standards. The younger sister represents the \"selfish\" self in the love relationship. After all, it is \"beautiful\" to be with the person you love the most and have each other. There is nothing wrong with loving each other. The only thing wrong is that they are sisters.  (Google Translate)"

That’s why Son blocks him on every platform after spending one date with him… Only for them to bump into each other again two years later.  It all begins with Son’s sweet tooth and his dessert ASMR channel which leads to none other than some serious dental problems. Seeking help, Son walks right into Jay’s path, who is a dentistry student. If that is no coincidence enough, Jay also just starts working night shifts at the convenience store in Son’s apartment building. At this point, even if Son wants to run, he doesn’t have much chance of escaping. Even two years later, Jay is still consistently a narcissist, but Son is thinking of giving this love another go, because maybe, just maybe, this time it will work out."
