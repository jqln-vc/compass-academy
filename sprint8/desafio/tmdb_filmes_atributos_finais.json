His most prized possession, the dvd of the film stays in his little trunk under his chowki (bed) until he takes it out every night and puts it into his battered but not run-down collected and repaired dvd player which brings to him his Ariel (the name of the mermaid in the film). The Ganges calls out to him and while his friends (group members) are sloshed, he dives into the waters to look for his mermaid queen, but she is ever-elusive."
